# Apple Dev Skill
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/ohlulu/Apple-Dev-Skill/blob/main/LICENSE)

Expert Apple platform development guidance for any AI coding tool that supports the [Agent Skills open format](https://agentskills.io/home) — UIKit patterns, Xcode/Tuist project setup, and Swift coding conventions for app development.

## Who this is for
- Teams building or maintaining UIKit-based iOS/iPadOS apps
- Developers setting up Xcode projects with Tuist, XcodeGen, or pure Xcode
- Anyone reviewing Swift code in an Apple app context

## How to Use This Skill

### Option A: Using skills.sh
```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/ohlulu/Apple-Dev-Skill --skill apple-dev-skill
```

### Option B: Using pi package manager
```bash
pi install https://github.com/ohlulu/Apple-Dev-Skill
```

### Option C: Manual install
1. Clone this repository
2. Install or symlink `apple-dev-skill/` following your tool's skills installation docs

## What's Inside

Three domains unified under a single Topic Router. Reference files load on demand, so your agent gets deep guidance only for the topic at hand.

### UIKit / UI Patterns

| Reference | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| file-structure | Property ordering, extensions, layout placement for VC / View / Cell |
| animation | Duration, curve, fade defaults, stagger reveal |
| list-composition | Row/item controllers, section controllers, load-more, pagination, diffable, compositional layout |
| composer | Programmatic controller instantiation, dependency wiring, navigation closures |
| testing-principles | Test levels, async spies, assertion strategy, memory leak tracking |
| testing | UIKit lifecycle simulation, semantic list helpers, pagination integration tests |
| uiview-representable | SwiftUI bridging — diff-based updates, coordinator callbacks, pre-rendered bitmaps |
| *(24 reference files total)* | |

### Xcode / Project Setup

| Reference | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| xcode-project-setup | Workspace layout, synced folders, SPM deps, app identity, shared schemes, gotchas |
| xcconfig | Hierarchy, naming, inline vs file, Xcode upgrade SOP |
| build-phases | SwiftFormat hook, SwiftLint, Firebase Crashlytics, sandboxing |
| makefile | Design principles, simulator destination, run target |
| tuist-spm-integration | Native vs XcodeProj-based, migration steps |
| xcodebuild-error-detection | Dual failure detection pattern |

### Swift Coding Style

| Reference | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| swift-style | Type design, protocols, error handling, API design, file organization |

Non-opinionated: focuses on correctness and practical patterns, not architecture or code style enforcement.
